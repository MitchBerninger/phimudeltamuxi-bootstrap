                <h2>Dear Alumni,</h2>
            <div class="textBox">
              <p>My name is Ryan Bollinger and I want to extend my greetings to you as the fall 2016 Alumni chairman for the Mu Xi Chapter. I am writing to you to inform you all what has all happened this semester and what all we have accomplished.</p>
              <h3>Parent Family Weekend</h3>
              <p>This past fall semester on the weekend of October 1st, we had our parent family weekend at the house like we have had the past few years. Even though it rained we made the best of it. Thanks to the parents and their generous donations, we had a very delicious pot luck dinner. After the dinner we shared a slide show of what the fraternity is all about and shared some of the more recent things we did and do as a chapter. Everyone seemed to enjoy it and went on the rest of the evening socializing and getting to know one another’s parents.</p>

              <h3><i>Events We Have Done So Far...</i></h3>
              <h3>Move in Weekend (U-Haul Crew)</h3>
              <p>Over the past few years we have been helping the school move in people the first weekend of school for on campus living. A lot of these people are first year students and we try to make their lives easy and fun their first moments on campus moving into their dorms. We have all been there and all know what it’s like to move in and away from your parents for possible the first time. We try to help and make it a little easier on the students and their parents when they move in so it goes smoothly.</p>
              <h3>Riverwalk</h3>
              <p>Within this first week/weekend we do a cleanup of the local Riverwalk that anyone can join in on to help out with. What we do is go on the local river walk, either on north or south side Williamsport, and pick up any trash we see along the way. We also get to socialize and talk to everyone there that participates and we get to get to know one another better.</p>
              <h3>Car Wash</h3>
              <p>This year all of Greek Life got together and helped wash all the Penn College police cars, just to show our gratification for what they do for us on a daily basis.</p>
              <h3>5K Color Run</h3>
              <p>At this event, the brothers all help out at the local Hepburn Lycoming 5K “color me LVIS” color run to help benefit the students at Lycoming Valley Intermediate School. At this event we get to actually participate in the “throwing of the color” to the participating runners. The color thrown is a powder and when runners go by our stations we gently throw it at them. This was the 2nd annual and we have helped them both years. Each year the brothers have had a blast doing this and look forward to it in years to come.</p>
              <h3>Millbrook Chilli Cook-off</h3>
              <p>Any brother over the age of 21 was eligible to participate in the service event at Millbrook. What they did there was help them set up their craft beer and chilli cook off festival called “Brews in the Barn.” During the event they kept areas clean and neat. They also bussed food in and out of the kitchen. After the event, they helped clean and tear down everything from the event.</p>
              <h3>Suicide Awareness Walk</h3>
              <p>On October 22 the brothers both participated and helped put at a suicide awareness walk being held at the school.  There were 12 brothers that helped out with the walk. What they did was be guides along the walk to direct people where to go. Other brother then participated in the walk and raised over $150 for the cause.</p>
              <h3>St. Jude Charity Car Show</h3>
              <p>This year on October 1st we held our very first car show where 100% of the proceeds went to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. There we had 12 raffle baskets and 6 awards were given out that were voted on by the spectators. Though it was a very rainy day outside we still made the best of it and had a total of 26 cars there. In total we raised $610 for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. We are already planning the next one so stay tuned for more details!</p>

              <h3><i>Meet The New Members...</i></h3>
              <h3>Andrew Zuniga</h3>

              <h3>Greg Hidlay</h3>
              <p>Greg is a freshman in the information technology major specializing in networking. He joined Phi Mu Delta for three major reasons.

An interesting fact about Greg is that he is a supervisor at Knoebels Amusement Park.</p>
              <h3>Cody Daniels</h3>

              <h3>Kevin Hoffman</h3>
              <p>Kevin is a freshman in the machine tool technology major.

              <p>Hope all is well with all of our alumni. We look forward to seeing you at our annual Alumni weekend next semester. Information on that will be finalized soon.</p>
